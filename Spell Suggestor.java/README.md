## Getting Started

Hello, this is a software used to generate word suggestions given a word prefix and the amount of suggestions you would like for each letter typed in the prefix.

## Folder Structure

In the src file contains 3 files. A csv file containing 333,333 most frequently used types from Googleâ€™s Trillion Word Corpus, along with the frequencies of those types, a Java program for the word suggestor, and another to read the csv file.

The class "Spelling" contains a function "suggest" which returns a list of a list of "count" amount of suggestions for each letter typed in the given prefix.
